51	AT4G15210	bmy1-2	Plants cold-shocked for 6h have an increased starch content compared to wildtype.	16297066	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
52	AT4G15560	cla1-1	Mutant seeds grown on medium supplemented with non-phosphorylated synthetic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose (DX) develop green leaves.	10982425	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
53	AT4G15570	maa3	Homozygotes are not recovered. Female gametophyte development is delayed and asynchronous. During fertilization, fusion of polar nuclei does not occur. Polar nuclei nucloeli are smaller than WT.	18772186	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
54	AT4G15802	Athspb-2	Early flowering, reduced fertility, aborted seeds.	20388662	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
55	AT4G15880	esd4-2	Decreased mRNA levels of the floral repressors FLC and MAF4 and increased mRNA levels of the floral activators FT and SOC1.	17513499	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294

59	AT5G10510	plt3-1	Short roots and shortened root meristem.	17960244	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
60	AT5G11110	kns2	Defects are specific to pollen exine structure. Smaller mesh size in the exine structure. Increased number of baculae. Fully fertile.	18779216	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
61	AT5G11260	hy5-101	Under FRc conditions, the length mutant hypocotyls is increased compared to that of wild-type plants.  Under Rc conditions, the hypocotyl length is also increased and the cotyledon area is smaller.	16891401	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294

63	AT5G12200	pyd2-2	The pyd2-2 mutant has a wild-type appearance under normal growth conditions. Pyrimidine nucleotide and uridine levels are not changed in the mutant, but uracil levels are increased. These mutants cannot grow normally when uracil is provided as a sole nitrogen source.	19413687	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
64	AT5G13290	crn-1	Increased meristem size. Vegetative meristems are are 30% larger than wild type. After bolting inflorescence meristems are enlarged and occasionally fasciated. Flowers occasionally produce extra organs in the first 3.	12345678	21	AT4G15570	MAA3	294
